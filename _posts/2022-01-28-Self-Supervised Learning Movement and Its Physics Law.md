**Content**:

•Simulated the scenes of robots with MuJuCo;

•Analyzed what parameters are needed in the model and what to be expected from the model under the condition of the fourscenarios of robots grasping the target,

•Utilized self-supervised datasets to learn the physics law through a robot (based on PINN and SymbolicGPT);

•Implentmented PINN + SymbolicGPT into a robot to evaluate its movement mode and the physics law behind it.
