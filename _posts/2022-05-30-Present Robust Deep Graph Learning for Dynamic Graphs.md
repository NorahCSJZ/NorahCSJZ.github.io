•Extracted the features from datasets of the brain network, DBLP, Epinion, Reddit , mdke adjacency matrix for each time step, andpreprocessed the dynamic Graph;

•Used GNNs for dynamic Graph and Graph Structure Learning to get a better and clean graph;

•Improved the performance of dynamic Graph Neural Network, its denoising part with AdaNN and the denoise method in PTDNet.
