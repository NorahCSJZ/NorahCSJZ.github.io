•Used multimodal Graph NN on the different representations of brain network based on the two brain networks datasets:DTInetwork and fMRI network;

•Combined the learned features of both sides, and used MLP to extract the features together;

•Designed a unique loss function to gather information from the above two brain networks, and iterated each feature to get a new model.
